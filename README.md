## Workflow

I have to say that this homework assignment was the funnest one I've had! It was mostly fun because I did this with my study group. It was a TON of fun to progress through the tests, outputting a file and fixing errors.

The first thing we did was get one test to work. We then tried to finish the entire suite before moving on to a new suite. This was the fun part! Seeing each passed test and then figuring out how to get the next one to pass.

Next we worked on writing the file. One member of our study group had most of it working but was missing something. Another member pointed out a variable that was incorrect. I happened to be taking a screenshot to try out the writing file code as he ran his code again. There's this big smile on all of our faces as we saw his code work!

Next I worked on a bit of code with my tutor. My tutor pointed out some flaws in my code. These flaws were breaking me out of what I was trying to do and creating errors. I really enjoyed this tutoring session because I was able to figure out how to fix my code based on questions my tutor was asking me. It really felt like I was making progress. My tutor noted that I was getting the concepts but that I was going down a few rabbit holes. Which were creating my errors.

The last thing to do was styling the generated page. I wanted to make it look nicer than the basic template that was being generated. Around that same time, [Zac](https://github.com/themancalledzac) (a study group member) pointed our group to a nice way to style our README markdowns using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/). I decided to impliment this at the same time as using Bootstrap's class styles.

Actually, the last thing to dow as record how the application works using [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/). But who's keeping track of that. Oh wait, I am.
