## Workflow

I have to say that this homework assignment was the funnest one I've had! It was mostly fun because I did this with my study group and it was a TON of fun to progress through the tests, outputting a file and fixing errors.

- tests with study group
- writing file with study group
- tutor time fixed my .then if.
- styled with bootstrap classes
- README formatting from Zac
